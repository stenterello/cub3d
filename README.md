# cub3d

The "Cub3D" repository contains my implementation of the Cub3D project from the 42School curriculum. Cub3D is a raycasting-based game engine that renders a 3D world from a 2D map.

## Description

The Cub3D project is an exciting and challenging endeavor that involves creating a raycasting game engine from scratch. The project requires implementing various features, including parsing a map file, rendering a textured 3D world, handling player movement and collision detection, and incorporating basic game elements like sprites and sound.

During the development process, I went above and beyond the project requirements and completed the bonus objectives, further enhancing the capabilities and visual appeal of the game engine.

To compile for platforms, there are multiple ways to compile the Cub3D project:

For macOS:

- Use `make` to compile the standard version.
- Use `make bonus` to compile the version with bonus features.

For Linux:

- Use `make lin` to compile the standard version.
- Use `make lin_bon` to compile the version with bonus features.

Please note that the compilation steps may vary depending on the operating system and requirements. Make sure to follow the appropriate compilation instructions to ensure a successful build.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local system:
	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/stenterello/Cub3D.git

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:
	```shell
	cd cub3d

3. Compile the project using the appropriate make command based on your platform:

- For macOS:

	- Standard version: make
	- Bonus version: make bonus

- For Linux:

	- Standard version: make lin
	- Bonus version: make lin_bon

These commands will compile the Cub3D game engine and generate the executable file.

4. Run the game:
	```shell
	./cub3d path/to/map.cub

Replace path/to/map.cub with the path to your desired map file.
